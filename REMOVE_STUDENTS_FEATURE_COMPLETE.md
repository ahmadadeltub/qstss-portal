# 🎯 REMOVE STUDENTS FROM REGISTRATION - FEATURE COMPLETE

## Feature Overview

Added the ability to remove individual students from competition registrations in the MyRegistrations page, giving teachers more flexibility in managing their registrations.

## New Functionality

### ✨ **Remove Individual Students**
- Teachers can now remove specific students from existing registrations
- Smart validation prevents removing the last student (must cancel entire registration instead)
- Only allowed before competition deadline and for upcoming competitions
- Clear visual feedback with tooltips explaining why removal might be disabled

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend API Endpoint 🔧

**New Route:** `DELETE /api/registrations/:registrationId/students/:studentId`

```javascript
// Remove student from registration
router.delete('/:registrationId/students/:studentId', authenticateToken, async (req, res) => {
  // Validates:
  // - Registration exists and user owns it
  // - Deadline hasn't passed
  // - Competition is still upcoming
  // - Student exists in registration
  // - Not the last student (prevents empty registrations)
});
```

**Validation Rules:**
- ✅ User must own the registration (or be admin)
- ✅ Current date must be before competition deadline
- ✅ Competition status must be 'upcoming'
- ✅ Student must exist in the registration
- ✅ Cannot remove the last student (must cancel entire registration)

**Error Messages:**
- `"Access denied - You can only modify your own registrations"`
- `"Cannot remove students after deadline. The registration deadline for [Competition] was [Date]."`
- `"Cannot remove students from this competition. The competition '[Name]' is no longer accepting modifications (status: [status])."`
- `"Student not found in this registration"`
- `"Cannot remove the last student. Cancel the entire registration instead."`

### 2. Frontend API Service 📡

**New Method:** `removeStudentFromRegistration(registrationId, studentId)`

```typescript
async removeStudentFromRegistration(registrationId: string, studentId: string) {
  const response = await api.delete(`/registrations/${registrationId}/students/${studentId}`);
  return response.data;
}
```

### 3. Frontend UI Components 🎨

#### **Student Cards with Remove Buttons**
- Each student card now has a remove button (PersonRemove icon)
- Button positioned in top-right corner of student card
- Smart enable/disable based on removal eligibility
- Tooltips explain why removal might be disabled

#### **Confirmation Dialog**
- Prevents accidental removals
- Shows student name and competition name
- Clear action buttons: "Cancel" vs "Remove Student"
- Loading state during removal process

#### **Enhanced Error Handling**
```typescript
// Comprehensive error categorization
if (error.response?.data?.error) {
  errorMessage = error.response.data.error;
} else if (error.response?.status === 400) {
  errorMessage = 'Cannot remove this student. The deadline may have passed or this is the last student.';
} else if (error.response?.status === 403) {
  errorMessage = 'Access denied. You can only modify your own registrations.';
}
// ... more error handling
```

## User Experience Features

### 🎯 **Visual Indicators**
- **Enabled Button:** Green remove icon with tooltip "Remove student from registration"
- **Disabled Button:** Grayed out icon with specific reason tooltip:
  - "Registration is cancelled"
  - "Competition is completed"
  - "Deadline passed (MM/DD/YYYY)"
  - "Cannot remove last student - cancel registration instead"

### 🔔 **Feedback System**
- **Success:** "[Student Name] has been removed from [Competition Name]"
- **Error:** Detailed error message explaining why removal failed
- **Auto-refresh:** Registration list updates after successful removal

### 🛡️ **Safety Features**
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental clicks
- Cannot remove last student (preserves registration integrity)
- Deadline enforcement (no changes after deadline)
- Ownership validation (users can only modify their own registrations)

## Validation Logic

### ✅ **Student Can Be Removed When:**
```typescript
const canRemoveStudent = (registration) => {
  const deadline = new Date(registration.competition.registrationDeadline);
  const now = new Date();
  return deadline > now && 
         registration.status !== 'cancelled' && 
         registration.competition.status === 'upcoming' &&
         registration.students.length > 1; // More than 1 student
};
```

### ❌ **Student Cannot Be Removed When:**
- Registration is cancelled
- Competition deadline has passed
- Competition is no longer upcoming (active/completed)
- Student is the last one in registration
- User doesn't own the registration
