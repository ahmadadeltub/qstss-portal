## Key Improvements Made

### Backend Enhancements (`/backend/routes/reports.js`)

1. **Enhanced Competition Export**:
   ```javascript
   // Now includes detailed participant data
   const detailedCompetitions = await Promise.all(
     competitionsData.map(async (comp) => {
       const registrations = await Registration.find({ competition: comp._id })
         .populate('teacher', 'firstName lastName department')
         .populate('students.student', 'firstName lastName studentId grade class')
         .lean();
       // ... calculate totals and organize data
     })
   );
   ```

2. **Comprehensive Export**:
   ```javascript
   // Two-tier structure: COMPETITION_SUMMARY + PARTICIPANT_DETAIL
   data.push({
     section: 'COMPETITION_SUMMARY',
     competitionName: comp.name,
     // ... all competition details
   });
   
   // Individual participant rows
   data.push({
     section: 'PARTICIPANT_DETAIL', 
     // ... student and teacher details
   });
   ```

3. **Fixed Prize Formatting**:
   ```javascript
   prizes: comp.prizes && comp.prizes.length > 0 ? 
     comp.prizes.map(p => `${p.position}: ${p.description} (${p.value})`).join('; ') : 
     ''
   ```

### Frontend Enhancements (`/frontend/src/pages/Reports.tsx`)

1. **New Export Options**:
   ```tsx
   <MenuItem value="comprehensive">üìä Comprehensive Report (All Details)</MenuItem>
   <MenuItem value="competitions">üèÜ Detailed Competitions Report</MenuItem>
   ```

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   ```tsx
   // Better blob handling and error messages
   let errorMessage = 'Failed to load reports data. Please try again.';
   if (err.response?.status === 401) {
     errorMessage = 'Authentication failed. Please log in again.';
   }
   ```

3. **Improved Download Process**:
   ```tsx
   // Proper blob handling with cleanup
   const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
   link.click();
   window.URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
   ```
