# CSV SORTING COMPLETION SUMMARY

## Task Completed Successfully âœ…

**OBJECTIVE**: Sort students in the Teacher Portal database according to the new CSV file order provided by the user.

## What Was Accomplished

- Created `csvImportFromFile.js` that reads directly from the `students.csv` file
- Maintains exact CSV order during import using `ordered: true` in MongoDB insertMany
- Processes all 242 students while preserving their sequence

### 2. **Database Re-imported** ðŸ’¾
- Successfully cleared existing student data
- Re-imported all 242 students in CSV file order
- Verified data integrity and completeness

### 3. **Order Verification** âœ…
