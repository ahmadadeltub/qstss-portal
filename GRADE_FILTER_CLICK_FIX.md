# 🎯 GRADE FILTER CLICK ISSUE - DIAGNOSIS & SOLUTION

## 📊 **Issue Status: IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED**

### **🔍 Root Cause Analysis:**
The Grade 11 and 12 filters were not working due to Material-UI Select component rendering issues. The backend API works perfectly for all grades.

### **✅ What Works:**
1. **Backend API**: All grade filters (9, 10, 11-Engineering/IT/Medical, 12-Engineering/IT/Medical) work correctly
2. **URL Parameters**: Direct grade filtering via URL works perfectly
3. **Grade 9 & 10**: Basic grades work in the dropdown

### **❌ What Was Broken:**
1. **Material-UI Select**: Click handling for Grade 11 and 12 options in the dropdown
2. **Component Rendering**: Complex conditional rendering caused click event issues
